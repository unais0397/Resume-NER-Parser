The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan\napproach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.\n.\nRoles and Responsibilities: Development, Testing and support.\nSoftware Used: Oracle 9i\n\nOTHER PROJECTS AND REAL TIME TRAINING:\n\nRTRM(Railway Ticketing System Through Mobile)\nA mobile based real time application with many exciting features like checking pnr status, train\navailability, trains between stations etc. This application was done in j2me and it uses weblogic\nas server and MSSQL as the database.\n\nUndergone a mandatory Training on Finance By Oracle Corporation\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBirla Institute Of Technology -  Pilani, Rajasthan\n\n2011\n\nBachelor of Technology in Computer Science\n\nUniversity College Of Engineering, University Of Kerala\n\n2005 to 2009\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nSKILL SET:\n\n\n\nLanguages: Core Java\nFront end/GUI Tools programming: Adobe Flex, GWT\nDatabase: Oracle 10g\nIDE: Eclipse, FlexBuilder\nFrameWorks: Spring(Basics), MVC frame work\nOperating System: Windows, Linux, Unix", "annotation": [{"label": ["SKILLS"], "points": [{"start": 4652, "end": 4849, "text": "Languages: Core Java\nFront end/GUI Tools programming: Adobe Flex, GWT\nDatabase: Oracle 10g\nIDE: Eclipse, FlexBuilder\nFrameWorks: Spring(Basics), MVC frame work\nOperating System: Windows, Linux, Unix"}]}, {"label": ["COLLEGE NAME"], "points": [{"start": 4543, "end": 4575, "text": "University College Of Engineering"}]}, {"label": ["DEGREE"], "points": [{"start": 4499, "end": 4540, "text": "Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science"}]}, {"label": ["COLLEGE NAME"], "points": [{"start": 4441, "end": 4470, "text": "Birla Institute Of Technology "}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 4410, "end": 4427, "text": "Oracle Corporation"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 2654, "end": 2671, "text": "Oracle Corporation"}]}, {"label": ["DESIGNATION"], "points": [{"start": 2632, "end": 2651, "text": "Associate Consultant"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 1260, "end": 1277, "text": "Oracle Corporation"}]}, {"label": ["DESIGNATION"], "points": [{"start": 1238, "end": 1257, "text": "Associate Consultant"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 603, "end": 615, "text": "State Street\n"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 487, "end": 504, "text": "Oracle Corporation"}]}, {"label": ["DESIGNATION"], "points": [{"start": 465, "end": 484, "text": "Associate Consultant"}]}, {"label": ["EMAIL"], "points": [{"start": 97, "end": 143, "text": " indeed.com/r/Ijas-\nNizamuddin/6748d77f76f94eed"}]}, {"label": ["LOCATION"], "points": [{"start": 53, "end": 66, "text": "Irinchayam B.O"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 39, "end": 51, "text": "State Street\n"}]}, {"label": ["DESIGNATION"], "points": [{"start": 16, "end": 35, "text": "Associate Consultant"}]}, {"label": ["NAME"], "points": [{"start": 0, "end": 14, "text": "Ijas Nizamuddin"}]}], "extras": null}

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux", "annotation": [{"label": ["SKILLS"], "points": [{"start": 7880, "end": 8485, "text": "Programming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux"}]}, {"label": ["SKILLS"], "points": [{"start": 7745, "end": 7836, "text": "optimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)"}]}, {"label": ["COLLEGE NAME"], "points": [{"start": 7687, "end": 7721, "text": "Day Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n"}]}, {"label": ["COLLEGE NAME"], "points": [{"start": 7664, "end": 7679, "text": "ANNA University\n"}]}, {"label": ["DEGREE"], "points": [{"start": 7652, "end": 7661, "text": "B.E in CSE"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 6598, "end": 6610, "text": "Cisco Systems"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 5629, "end": 5649, "text": "Automation & Testing\n"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 5560, "end": 5572, "text": "Cisco Systems"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 3651, "end": 3671, "text": "Automation & Testing\n"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 3503, "end": 3515, "text": "Cisco Systems"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 3481, "end": 3501, "text": "Automation & Testing\n"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 1304, "end": 1324, "text": "Automation & Testing\n"}]}, {"label": ["DESIGNATION"], "points": [{"start": 1288, "end": 1300, "text": "Lead Engineer"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 1174, "end": 1186, "text": "Cisco Systems"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 1152, "end": 1172, "text": "Automation & Testing\n"}]}, {"label": ["DESIGNATION"], "points": [{"start": 1136, "end": 1148, "text": "Lead Engineer"}]}, {"label": ["EMAIL"], "points": [{"start": 102, "end": 165, "text": "Indeed: indeed.com/r/Yasothai-Jayaramachandran/\nc36e76b64d9f477f"}]}, {"label": ["LOCATION"], "points": [{"start": 64, "end": 70, "text": "Chennai"}]}, {"label": ["COMPANY"], "points": [{"start": 42, "end": 62, "text": "Automation & Testing\n"}]}, {"label": ["DESIGNATION"], "points": [{"start": 26, "end": 38, "text": "Lead Engineer"}]}, {"label": ["NAME"], "points": [{"start": 0, "end": 24, "text": "Yasothai Jayaramachandran"}]}], "extras": null}

INI Parsing tool is a tool\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\n\n\n\nModule - Man Machine Language\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - Configuration Management\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static\nconfiguration data.\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - TL1\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\nback to TL1 Response messages\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network. • WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. • The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized • Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.
